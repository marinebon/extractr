# extractr

The goal of the `extractr` R library is to provide easy to use extraction and summarization functions in R for common datasets (ERDDAP, Google Earth Engine, DataOne, etc).

For an example on how to use the functions, please see [Get started](articles/extractr.html).

## Roadmap

ERDDAP:

- [x] &nbsp; Basic extraction from polygon for ERDDAP datasets: `get_ed_grds()`
- [x] &nbsp; Utility functions for ERDDAP metadata: `ed_dims()`, `ed_dim()`, 
- [ ] &nbsp; Improve raster generation for non-rectilinear grids: [#3](https://github.com/marinebon/extractr/issues/3)

Google Earth Engine (GEE):

- [ ] &nbsp; Basic extraction from polygon for GEE datasets: [#4](https://github.com/marinebon/extractr/issues/3)
